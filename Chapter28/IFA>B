Lines 5 and 6 convert B into two complement form (-B)
Line 7 adds A to -B 
IF The result of A - B is +ve then A > B
To check if result is +Ve Determine whether or not leading bit is 0 
Perform AND with ACC and 1000
CMP with 0 (0111 AND 1000 -> 0 therefore +Ve)
JPE True (Jump to code that we perform if A > B )
